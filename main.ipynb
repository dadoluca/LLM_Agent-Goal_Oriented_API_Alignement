      "Critique: The low-level goals generally align well with the high-level goals and provide a clear direction for implementing the Genome Nexus API. However, there are a few areas that could be improved. For instance, the description mentions support for JavaScript and TypeScript, but the low-level goal for developing SDKs only mentions Python, R, and Java, omitting the other supported languages. Additionally, there could be more emphasis on ensuring the long-term support of the '/annotation' endpoint as mentioned in the software description. Overall, the low-level goals are well-defined but could benefit from a bit more detail and inclusivity of all mentioned features.\n",

      "description=\"The Genome Nexus API is designed to provide access to genomic variant annotation data using HTTP requests. It offers a comprehensive solution for annotating variants with tools available in various programming languages such as Python, R, JavaScript, TypeScript, and others. Additionally, a command line client is provided for annotating MAF and VCF files. The primary stable endpoint offered for long-term support is '/annotation', while other endpoints may undergo changes.\\n\\nThe API facilitates variant annotation via several endpoints, allowing users to retrieve Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) annotations for a given list of variants, dbSNP IDs, or genomic locations. It supports querying with optional parameters such as isoform override sources (e.g., Uniprot) and specific fields for inclusion in the response (e.g., hotspots).\\n\\nBesides programmatic access, web-based tools are also available to annotate variants, providing flexibility for users who prefer different modes of interaction. The comprehensive suite of endpoints covers functionalities including retrieving Ensembl canonical gene IDs by Entrez Gene IDs or Hugo Symbols, fetching PDB headers, querying PFAM domains, and accessing post-translational modifications by Ensembl Transcript IDs.\\n\\nThe project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License, ensuring that it is freely available and can be modified or distributed by the community. Further documentation and detailed usage instructions can be found at https://docs.genomenexus.org/api.\"\n",

      "Critique: The high-level goals generally align with the software description, covering key aspects such as access to genomic variant annotation data, support for multiple programming languages, and the availability of a command line client and web-based tools. However, some goals seem more like features or functionalities rather than high-level goals, which typically should be broader and more abstract, focusing on the overall objectives and benefits the system aims to provide to its users. For example, \"Retrieve additional genomic data\" could be seen as a feature supporting a higher-level goal of \"Enhance user research capabilities with comprehensive genomic data.\" Additionally, there's no clear goal related to the open-source nature and community involvement, which is an important aspect of the project as it ensures the software is \"freely available and can be modified or distributed by the community.\"\n",

Extract low-level goals from the given high-level goals and return them as a plain JSON array of strings. The low-level goals that you create MUST be structured to match against a set of API calls. Don't be too generic, for example, avoid goals like 'make the software fast', 'develop a web interface' etc. MUST focus only on functional requirements and ignore non-functional requirements. Focus only on requirements that benefit the end user of the software. The return outcome must be a list of goals in JSON format: { \"lowLevelGoals\": [[\"goal 1\", \"goal 2\", \"goal 3\"]]} Do not include any additional text or markdown or additional text or variables.

      "Critique: The low-level goals provided are generally well-defined and accurately reflect the high-level goals. However, there are a few areas where the goals could be more specific or detailed. For example, the goal \"Implement HTTP endpoints to receive and respond to variant annotation requests\" could be broken down into more specific goals, such as defining the exact HTTP methods to be used (e.g., GET, POST) and the format of the request and response bodies. Additionally, some low-level goals, such as \"Develop API endpoints for variant annotation accessible by Python scripts\", could be more specific about what \"accessible\" means (e.g., do the endpoints need to return data in a specific format for Python scripts?). Overall, the low-level goals provide a good foundation for implementation, but could benefit from some refinement and detail.\n",
